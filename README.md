# Object-Oriented JavaScript practice
![Showcase](/demo.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")

This project was made for the [Object-Oriented JavaScript course by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-2593668697/m-2955818684).

The base of the project was created by **Udacity** and can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).

Open the ```index.html``` file or start a simple python web server on windows with the ```run``` command (the webapp can then be accesed on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/))

Use the arrows (up, down, left, right) to navigate your character

I will continue to add improvements to the game to practice the technology.
